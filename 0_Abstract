This  process  is commonly used  in  most  areas  of the  world.  Recently,  globalization  and industrialization has further  necessitated the need for  Temperature
Automatic temperature control system is an important application used in almost all modern gadgets and smart homes. 
The system for controlling temperature automatically is achieved by using Arduino Uno-based microcontroller system.
Arduino Uno due to its increased popularity finds its varied range of applications. 
Temperature sensor LM35 and Arduino Uno are the hardware used interfaced with computer,
 and the temperature is controlled in the room.
