Real time circuit simulation 
Real Time Circuit Simulation is a process which uses mathematical models to replicate the behavior of an actual electronic device or circuit.
Simulation allows the modeling of circuit operation and is an invaluable analysis process. 
Simulating a circuit's behavior before actually building it can greatly improve design efficiency by making faulty designs known as such,
and providing insight into the behavior of electronics circuit designs. 
 In particular, for integrated circuits, the tooling (photomasks) is expensive, breadboards are impractical,
 and probing the behavior of internal signals is extremely difficult. 
 Circuit simulation is a process in which a model of an electronic circuit is created and analyzed using various software algorithms, 
 which predict and verify the behavior and performance of the circuit.
